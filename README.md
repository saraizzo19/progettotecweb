# coDHex
We are two master's students studying Humanities and Digital Technologies at the University of Naples "L'Orientale". During our Web Technologies course, we designed this web app with the aim of facilitating the selection and management of bibliographic sources.
Why the name 'coDHex'? The name of this project comes from the combination of the Latin word codex ('text', 'manuscript book') and the acronym for Digital Humanities. As students who are engaged in writing texts, articles or theses on a daily basis, we experience first-hand the problem of the gap between identifying relevant sources and integrating them correctly into the writing process: coDHex aims to simplify this work for you. We therefore offer the generation of sources, through the insertion of metadata into a special font with a choice of four different citation styles, and their storage in a reserved area.
The website consists of several HTML pages, complete with CSS and JavaScript, with the relevant PHP for connecting to the database, connecting to the latter and interconnecting the pages that need to communicate with each other.
